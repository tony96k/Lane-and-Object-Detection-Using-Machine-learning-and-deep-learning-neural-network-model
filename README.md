Hello welcome to my project. This project is developed on Pycharm and uses libraries such as opencv marplot lib , if in any case the program doesn’t work make sure you have installed all necessary libraries 

Process :
Since you are trying to detect a lane from a video you would most obviously need a video of road from car point of view. In case you don’t have it I have provided a sample video for you to test the results. If you wish to process your own video make sure to name it input.mp4 and place it in the folder with Lane_detection.py

Run the Lane_detection.py from any python launcher . First the software will process video then it will be exported to output.mp4
